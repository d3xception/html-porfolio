<h1>The Best Movies <br />According to Greg</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Houls Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
  The movie's message of love and kindness resonates with audiences of all ages,
  making it one of the best films created by Studio Ghibli. Unlike its
  predecessors, Howl's Moving Castle is a love story. It is the story of Howl
  and Sophie falling in love and learning to accept themselves throughout the
  process.
</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>
  Spirited Away contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society
  concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues. Chihiro has been
  seen as a representation of the sh≈çjo, whose roles and ideology had changed
  dramatically since post-war Japan.
</p>
<h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
<p>
  My Neighbour Totoro is about the enchantment of childhood and, as so often,
  presents us with a supernatural world which has made visible to children
  because of some pain or trauma in their ordinary lives, a world which exists
  midway between hallucination and reality.
